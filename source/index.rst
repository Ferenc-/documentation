* **OpenStack** is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of
  compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed
  through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users
  to provision resources through a web interface. [#s1]_

* **Ceph** uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system. [#s2]_

* **Ansible** is a simple, agentless and powerful open source IT automation. [#s3]_

* **Docker** provides a way to run applications securely isolated in a container,
  packaged with all its dependencies and libraries. [#s4]_
